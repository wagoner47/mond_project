The calculation part of this code gives functions that can be used when testing data with MOND (**Mo**\ dified **N**\ ewtonian **D**\ ynamics). This includes functions for calculating the observed and expected accelerations from data as well as a function for the prediction assuming MOND as found in `Lelli et al. (2017)`_.
